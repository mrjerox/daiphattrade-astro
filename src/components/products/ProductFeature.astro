          Society has put up so many boundaries, so many limitations on what’s
          right and wrong that it’s almost impossible to get a pure thought out.
          It’s like a little kid, a little boy, looking at colors, and no one
          told him what colors are good, before somebody tells you you shouldn’t
          like pink because that’s for girls, or you’d instantly become a gay
          two-year-old.
